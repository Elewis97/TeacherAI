So... here are the statistics I've gathered so far
10 essays have been taken out of the running for testing purposes. The last 10
Also, the following distribution's total won't be 200 (as there are 210 total essays)
since any where the score was 0 is taken out of the running

Grade Distribution for Lead
2   ->  24
2.5 ->  41
3   ->  88
3.5 ->  18
4   ->  7
Total : 195

Grade Distribution for Ending
2   ->  35
2.5 ->  44
3   ->  65
3.5 ->  3
4   ->  4
Total : 174

Grade Distribution for Transitions
2   ->  29
2.5 ->  17
3   ->  78
3.5 ->  3
4   ->  0
Total : 194

Observations: Removing all essays that weren't given a score for ending or lead,
there is a 34% chance that the essay will have the same score for lead and ending
there is a 69% chance that the essay will have lead and ending score withing a 0.5 std dev
Due to the high probability that by just choosing the same lead and ending, we elected to
find the score for the lead, and then give the same score for the ending as we will be
70% likely to be correct within 0.5 pts.

Distribution for Ending grade if the word "Conclusion" is in the essay:
2   ->  6       
2.5 ->  11      26%
3   ->  23      55%
3.5 ->  1 
4   ->  1 
Total : 42 essays with the word conclusion in them

Therefore, if the word "conclusion" is in the essay, there is a 81% chance the essay
will have a score of 2.5 or 3


Distribution for Ending grade if the word "Conclusion" is NOT in the essay:
2   ->  29       
2.5 ->  33      
3   ->  42      
3.5 ->  2 
4   ->  3 
Total : 109 essays without the word conclusion in them

Since the results are more ambiguous, we cannot truly figure make assumptions based on if
conclusion is NOT included

ALSO!!!! Since very very few were ever given a 3.5 or a 4, if we never give out a score of 
3.5 or 4, we will have a high probability for correctness, even if it is a shitty move. 
And would never be put into production

Distribution of transition words
2   ->  7
2.5 ->  9
3   ->  40
3.5 ->  2
4   ->  0
Total : 58

As you can see, if those words are included, just default to a grade of 3, and you will have
a ~70% accuracy. So.... yeah

However, if the essay does not include those transition words... it doesn't tell us much
Distribution of transition words
2   ->  22
2.5 ->  8
3   ->  38
3.5 ->  1
4   ->  0
Total : 58

... but if I add more transition words?????
